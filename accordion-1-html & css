    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p> Within dentistry, veneers are defined as a thin layer (often only 0.1mm thick) of porcelain/ceramic or composite resin fitted to the outside surface of one or more teeth to their appearance. &#128522;</p>

    <label class="accordion-label" for="check2">What are the best porcelain veneers?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>Some of the best and most effective materials with quality reputations worldwide are Ivoclar Vivadent’s IPS E.max Press and Empress veneers, as well as Dentsply Sirona’s Celtra Press, and GC Lisi veneers.
        <br>
        At Marylebone Smile Clinic, we use a combination of these alongside a few other reinforced ceramics that are either lithium disilicate or silicon dioxide based that ensure a high strength to thickness ratio. This means that we are prepared with veneers suitable for a broad spectrum of cases.
        <br>
        However, we believe that more important than the material you choose, the skill of the dentist is what will have the best effect on the improvement of your smile.</p>

    <label class="accordion-label" for="check3"> Where can I find a cosmetic dentist to get porcelain veneers?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p> If you are searching for porcelain veneers in London then we recommend that you request to see portfolio examples of a dentist’s previous work and judge yourself whether their veneers look high quality, as well as read reviews from genuine customers.
        <br>
        Purely cosmetic veneers are excluded through public healthcare and so you need to find a suitable, experienced dentist in a private clinic. Marylebone Smile Clinic is located on Harley Street in London, where some of the best private medical facilities around the world are located.
        <br>
        Get in touch with our clinic and we can provide you with examples of our dentist’s work as well as proof of our qualifications, and feedback from our previous customers that include high-profile celebrities, members of parliament, and CEOs. </p>

    <label class="accordion-label" for="check4">What celebrities have veneer teeth?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p> Many celebrities around the world have turned to veneers to improve the aesthetic of their smile. For example:
        <br>Cheryl Cole – possibly one of the best results from a combined approach with veneers
        <br>Tom Cruise – A combination of crowns and veneers, he is on his 3rd set now!
        <br>Anna Kendrick – she had six veneers before her rise in Hollywood
        <br>Morgan Freeman – a long history of gum disease and we’re glad he finally had it treated and then had veneers</p>

    <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check5">
    <label class="accordion-label" for="check5">What are veneers made of?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>There have been updates to the composition of veneers in the UK over the years. While they used to be referred to as porcelain, the vast majority of veneer teeth do not contain porcelain. 
        <br>
        Another term for veneers that is used by dentists is ceramic. We prefer this term for the purposes of clarity. Ceramic refers to any inorganic material produced through the application of heat. This encompasses all previously known porcelains, metal-based ceramics, and the more modern synthetic materials. </p>

    <label class="accordion-label" for="check6">Do veneers hurt?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>You will receive local anaesthesia during your appointments that lasts for approximately 3 so you won’t feel any pain while your veneers are being applied.  </p>

    <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check7">
    <label class="accordion-label" for="check7">Are there downsides to veneers?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>As with most things in life, veneers do not last forever, around 10-20 years according to the latest in peer-reviewed dental research. When they begin to approach the end of their lifespan, you will need to come back in and get them replaced.
        <br>
        Your natural teeth may need to be reshaped again to allow the new veneers to fit onto them. We usually aim to preserve around 70-95% of each tooth, which incurs an approximate 2% risk to the nerve within the tooth becoming aggravated as a result of the procedure.  </p>

  <div class="accordion">
    <input type="radio" name="radio-a" id="check8">
    <label class="accordion-label" for="check8">What is an alternative to veneers?</label>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>There are a number of ceramic veneer substitutes that work to provide the same benefits. 
        You can have composite veneers that are made from an adhesive plastic resin and are applied directly to the tooth. These are different to ceramic veneers because they are not personally hand made. 
                                        <br>
        Composite veneers are easier to apply in comparison as they require less reshaping of your natural teeth and can therefore be sold at a lower cost. However, they are weaker than ceramic veneers and only last an average of 6-8 years. They also need repolishing every two years at a higher standard than normal home care. 
                                        <br>
        There are also brands like Lumineer, MAC, or Snap on Smile that sell variations on veneers. They are much weaker than veneers as they do not contain multiple layers. While they may be tempting due to the price and lack of reshaping needed in comparison to ceramic veneers, their aesthetic standards are severely compromised due to the improperly shaped tooth. 
                                        <br>
        CADCAM veneers are another alternative form of veneers. CADCAM stands for computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing. Constructing veneers this way by using a computer does not require the expertise of a skilled ceramist. While this may sound like a benefit, what it means in real terms is that CADCAM veneers cannot match the quality of hand-crafted ceramic veneers. However, the technology to create these veneers is improving every year so there is the potential for CADCAM veneers to become much better and more recommended in the future.</p>
